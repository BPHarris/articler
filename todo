auto table of contents
    generate numeric id for each {title, subtitle, subsubtitle, figure}
    
    other id = title level - relative subtitle level - relative subsubtitle level - relative figure number
        e.g.   t1-s1-s2-f1 is first figure in the 2 subsub of first sub of the first (usually only) title
    
    toc format
        foreach id:
            <a href="#id">indent + id number + title/subtitle/subsubtitle/figure</a>

    \autotoc 6 => table of conents with title and all h1-h6
